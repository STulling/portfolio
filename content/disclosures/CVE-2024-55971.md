description: "SQL Injection vulnerability in the default configuration of the Logitime WebClock application <= 5.43.0 allows an unauthenticated user to run arbitrary code on the backend database server. The vulnerability is due to the use of a default database user with full permissions. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted request to the web application, which will execute the payload on the backend database server."

advisory: "Update to version 5.44.0 or later and change the configuration to use a dedicated database user with limited permissions as explained in the documentation of the new version."
